## Analysis Steps

1. The dplyr and stringr libraries are loaded.
2. Each of the dataset files listed above in requirements are loaded into memory as data tables.
3. Each of the training and test files are concatenated by row to one file each (subject, x, and y)
4. The features and activity\_labels data tables are used to apply column names to the X (features) and Y (activities) data tables.
5. The subject, Y (activities) and X (features) tables are combined using column bind into one data table.
6. Grep is used to generate a subset of the data table for all columns that have mean() or std() in their name.  (Subject and Activity Label are included as well.)
7. The summary data set is generated by using the group\_by (Subject and Activity Label) and summarise\_each functions (mean of each column).
8. Abbrevations in column names are expanded to friendly names using the str\_replace\_all function.
9. The summary data set is exported to the working directory as "SamsungSummaryData.txt
